This year’s MVP awards told two different stories: the slugger who guided his team to a historic World Series win and the do-everything outfielder whose individual dominance couldn’t be overlooked despite playing for a fourth-place team.

Chicago Cubs slugger Kris Bryant gets the trophy in the National League, where there was little doubt he’d win. And Los Angeles Angels star Mike Trout got the surprising win in the AL since his team finished below .500 and Mookie Betts of the Boston Red Sox also had a strong MVP case.

In the NL, Bryant collected 29 of 30 first-place votes from the Baseball Writers Association of America. Daniel Murphy of the Washington Nationals finished second while Corey Seager of the Los Angeles Dodgers finished third. Bryant is the fourth player to win the Rookie of the Year and MVP in consecutive years.

In the AL, Trout earned 19 of 30 first-place votes. Betts finished second with nine first-place votes. Jose Altuve of the Houston Astros finished third. It’s Trout’s second MVP award. He’s the first player in 13 years to win it on a losing team.
